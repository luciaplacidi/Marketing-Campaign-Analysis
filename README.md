# Marketing Campaign Analysis and Visualization

## About the Data
The analysis was based on a dataset from Maven Analytics for their May 2021 challenge. The goal for this analysis is to
find how customers are spending their money and on what products.

The dataset contains a csv table with 2,240 records, one for each customer. It includes customer profiles, product
preferences, campaign success/failures, and channel performance.

Recommended Analysis:

1. Are there any null values or outliers? How will you handle them?

2. What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?

3. Which marketing campaign was the most successful?

4. What does the average customer look like?

5. Which products are performing best?

6. Which channels are underperforming?

## Data Prep and Analysis
* Remove blanks from dataset.
* Removed outliers from the 'Year_Birth' column as the customers would be over 100 years old (1893, 1900, 1903).
* Changed data types to currency for Income and Amount columns.
* Split Dt_Customer column by delimiter to get three columns for day, month and year.
* Replaced marital status of "Absurd", "Alone" and "YOLO" to "Single".
* Created a new conditional column to sort customers into 5 income groups.
* Created a column for 'Total Purchases Made' and 'Total Amount Spent'.

## Key Findings
* Most of their revenue is generated by customers from Spain.
* The last campaign had the highest number of responses and conversion rate.
* The channel that generated the most purchases came from directly in store, followed by the company's website.
* Most of their customers fall into the middle income group, earning between $25k and $60 per year.
* Their best performing product was wine with $675k, almost doubling the second highest performing product meat ($370k).
* The average customer is between 40 and 55 years old, has graduated high scool, earning between $25k and $100k, and has at least one dependent.
